  # Rules of Using Hooks in React JS

- 1- You have to use (use) at the time of initialization of your react js hooks

- 2- You can not use your state hooks in any function or block scope

- 3 Only call hooks from React functions: Hooks should only be called from within React functional components or custom hooks, not from regular JavaScript functions.

- 4- Hooks must follow the same order: Ensure that hooks are called in the same order on every render to preserve the state between renders correctly
